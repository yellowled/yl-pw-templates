# My boilerplate for ProcessWire

The default templates provided by [ProcessWire](http://processwire.com) hold a lot of stuff I usually drop when starting a new project. This is an already stripped-down version of said templates.

Note that this does not contain the default's CSS and JS files. I usually replace those with files provided by [my HTML project boilerplate](https://github.com/yellowled/yl-bp). Since I'm German and most of the sites I build are, too, I translated some hardcoded text into German.

## Snippets

The directory `snippets` contains some useful pieces of (PHP) code a site might or might not need.
