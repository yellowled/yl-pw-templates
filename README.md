# My boilerplate for ProcessWire

The default templates provided by [ProcessWire](http://processwire.com) holds a lot of stuff I usually drop when starting a new project. This is an already stripped-down version of said templates.

Note that this does not contain the default's CSS and JS files. I usually replace those with files provided by the [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate) as well as [my own addons](https://github.com/yellowled/yl-h5bp-addons) to that, since I prefer using Sass and Compass for CSS.
